Title:
Snake Classification using Neural-Backed Decision Trees

Abstract:
Many advanced algorithms, specifically deep learning models, are considered “black box” to human understanding.
Transparency to intrprete such models has become a key obstacle which prevents such algorithms from being put into 
practical use. Although algorithms, such as GradCam, are invented to provide
visual explanations from deep networks via gradient-based localization, they do not provide details of how the models
reached their final decision step by step in detail. The goal of this project is to provide more interpretability 
to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models by combining Grad-CAM with Neural Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs), 
and provide visual explanations with detailed decision making process of CNN models. This project
demonstrates the potential and limitations of jointly applying Grad-CAM and NBDTs on snake classification.
